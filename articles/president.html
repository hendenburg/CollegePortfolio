        <h1>When Thomas Ran for President</h1>
        <p></p>
        <p>Near the end of my junior year, most of my time was spent preparing for the Student-Body Presidency. I had taken it upon myself to organize a movement to improve my school, Northlake Christian. I had no real conflict with the administration, but I also knew that there are things that needed to be done if the school were to be better. </p>
        <p>It was quite an endeavor, preparing for the campaign, and I had spent most of it writing my manifesto, titled the "Free-Body Party." It was a 3000-word rambling essay on my problems with the school and how I would fix them. I scrapped most of it, but the ideas I presented there became a basis for the entire campaign.</p>

        <blockquote>The Free-Body doctrine is an attempt to treat student representation as merely a pipeline and voice for the students. If the status quo is persisted then representation would continue to be for one to advance themselves, rather than the school as a whole. The student body is not to be fooled, they understand the influence of change and communication. <cite>The Introduction of the Free-Body Plan</cite></blockquote>
        <p>It then became a collaborative affair. I knew that this would be impossible without the help of the students around me. Of course, the entire campaign was centralized around creating a voice for those who had none. I based many of the ideas in the campaign on Open Source Software philosophies. For instance, an extreme focus on the open nature of representation and the communication required, but also the trust that creates.</p>
